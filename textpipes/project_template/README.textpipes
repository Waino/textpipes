This is an example project directory template

You should do at least the following:
1) Modify the current_platform if you use a different platform
2) Set the paths in platform_local.ini

For each recipe:
1) Add the experiment parameters into a copy of config.ini.
   File paths should go under sections starting with paths
   [paths.SECTION]
   KEY = PATH
   where SECTION and KEY are what you refer to from the recipe.
2) Write your recipe into a copy of recipe.py
