- side inputs and outputs
    - files need to be opened, requires handing down conf, cli_args
        - don't want to do this in init: only when make is called
        - hand it down in __call__ / single_cell ?
            - single_cell has do do bookkeeping to only open it once
            - only in __call__, with handling in SingleCellComponent or PipeComponent ?
        - pre/post-make call ?
            - a lot of boilerplate

- slurm params from platform conf
- cli_args

- loop Rule that produces numbered outputs
    - helper to find highest numbered file
    - continuing from last
    - only show one line in human-friendly output

- tokenizer and truecaser have some rough edges

- use package resources instead of data in source tree
