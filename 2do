- side inputs and outputs
    - files need to be opened, requires handing down conf, cli_args
        % don't want to do this in init: only when make is called
        F hand it down in __call__ / single_cell ?
            - single_cell has do do bookkeeping to only open it once
        F pre/post-make call ?
            - a lot of boilerplate
        F only in __call__, with handling in SingleCellComponent or PipeComponent ?
        % in Pipe
            % don't want to tie Component to Pipe
            % pass in a dict RF -> fobj into __call__
            % still need an (empty if not needed) pre/post-make call for saving models
% what if there is no main_output to drive the generator?
    % e.g. if you just want to train a truecaser from a corpus file, and don't need the lines for anything else
    % third type of Pipe? DeadEndPipe
    - make a TokenizerRule that uses DeadEndPipe, for convenience?

- slurm params from platform conf
- cli_args

- loop Rule that produces numbered outputs
    - helper to find highest numbered file
    - continuing from last
    - only show one line in human-friendly output

- tokenizer and truecaser have some rough edges

- use package resources instead of data in source tree
